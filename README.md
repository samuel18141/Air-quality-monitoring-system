# Air-quality-monitoring-system
## The project is meant to monitor air quality for people living with Systemic lupus erythematosus
## The components included are as follows;
MQ135- for testing ozone.
MQ7- for testing carbon monoxide
MQ 2- for testing hydrogen gas
BUZZER
Liquid crystal display
Arduino uno
LM35 temperature sensor
DHT22
## The system works in such a way that when the gas sensors detects any impurities in the air the buzzer goes on to notify the patient that the environment air condition are not favourable for their health as well as the temperature readings as per the LM35 temperature sensor.
